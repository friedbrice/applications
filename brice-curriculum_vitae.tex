      {\bf Eagle Scout} --
      {\em 24 April 2002, Troop 110, Rialto CA.}\\
        From Wikipedia: {\em Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable
        in the Boy Scouting program. Requirements include ...
        demonstrating Scout Spirit through the Boy Scout Oath and Law,
        service, and leadership. This includes an extensive service
        project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages.}\\
        My service project involved organizing over 30 youth and adult
        volunteers, gathering donations, purchasing materials, and
        coordinating labor for building improvements at Grace Lutheran
        Church in Rialto, CA.

        Auburn supports a thriving community of puzzle-hunters that
        hosts several puzzle-hunts each year. In addition to regular
        participation, I have served as an organizer for two
        puzzle-hunts. I contributed through designing puzzles, event
        production, and event staffing.
    \item{}
      {\bf Linux Club President} --
      {\em Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Auburn U.}\\
        Scheduled meetings, reserved room, scheduled presenters,
        maintained membership list, maintained website.
    \item{}
      {\bf Science Olympiad} --
      {Habitual volunteer.}
      {\em various years, Auburn U.}\\
        Auburn University annually hosts the regional Science Olympiad.
        I have contributed by staffing events.
    \item{}
      {\bf AMP'd Challenge} --
      {Habitual volunteer.}
      {\em various years, Auburn U.}\\
        AMP'd Challenge is an annual mathematics puzzle-hunt for high
        school and middle school student sponsored by the Auburn U.
        College of Sciences and Mathematics. I have contributed by
        designing mathematical puzzles, judging solutions, and staffing
        events.
    \item{}
      {\bf Global Urban Datafest} --
      {Regional winner, global finalist.}
      {\em Spring 2015, Auburn AL.}\\
        Worked on a team with three other amateur programmers to develop
        a data-intensive web application over the course of one weekend.
        We created an app that analyzes webcam images via Canny edge
        detection, gradient vector fields, and principle component
        analysis to detect arbitrary unusual activity. Applications
        include automated surveillance, early-warning systems, and
        disaster recovery. We are currently finalists at the global
        bracket and awaiting the results. Our app is currently live on
        Amazon Web Services. You can view our project page on github:
