\vfill

In his \emph{Principia Mathematica,} philosopher and mathematician
Bertrand Russell argued, contrary to the common wisdom of the time,
that the study of Mathematics is not the study of what is necessarily
true.
Instead, Russel held that Mathematics is the study of what is verbally
true based on an understanding of the meanings of the terms used; i.e.,
that ``mathematical knowledge is, in fact, merely verbal knowledge''
about the meanings and relationships of mathematical terms.
Perhaps because of this different foundation, Russell's beliefs about
the instruction of Mathematics also diverged from the classical
philosophy of the traditional Mathematics classroom, which emphasizes
performance of a series of isolated computational problems.
Russell believed that conceptual understanding and critical thinking,
rather than rote memorization and performance of computational tasks,
should be the primary goal of Mathematics instruction.

I feel that Russell's educational philosophy anticipated the world in
which we live today, where computational facility seems almost
unnecessary to many students---who mistakenly believe that they can find
every answer they seek on a greenish-gray screen---but where the ability
to translate a problem into mathematical language is what will set them
apart from their peers. What good is a calculator to a student that does
not know the right question to ask? Let me make myself clear:
Computational fluency is an important ingredient for conceptual
understanding, but it should not be the sole goal of the Mathematics
classroom. So, like Russell, my teaching philosophy centers around not
the mere execution of mathematical tasks, but in communicating the
meaning underlying each task and how ideas framing those tasks relate
to one another.

I believe that students should know what they are doing. I believe that
it is valuable for them to understand the underpinnings of what they are
doing. To this end, I am particularly influenced by inquiry-based
learning, a school of thought which promotes learning by reasoning
through questions, constructing thought experiments, and engaging in
meaningful dialog. I incorporate these ideas into my classroom whenever
possible.

In my classroom, introductions to new topics begin collaboratively,
with students working through motivating examples. Unfamiliar terms are
introduced using familiar objects, creating relations between concepts
with which students are already comfortable. The meaning of a theorem is
illustrated in a variety of different situations, and conclusions are
attained through discussion. No concept exists in a vacuum:
meaning is derived from the context in which an idea is presented.
It is my conviction that treating new concepts in the absence of their
relationships to familiar concepts obscures the concept at had and
encourages a misunderstanding of the purpose of Mathematics.

Throughout the duration of my teaching experience, I have witnessed the
damage that the unmotivated approach to teaching Mathematics can
inflict, most apparent in every student who considers himself or herself
``not a math person.''
My goal within the classroom is to provide all students, including
students who think of themselves in this way, a new opportunity to
thrive.

My teaching philosophy emphasizes demystifying Mathematics in the eyes
of my students. I want my students to not look to outside authorities,
such as a teacher or the back of a textbook, for confirmation,
but to their own ability to verify their work themselves;
to view themselves as equipped with basic verbal reasoning skills that
Mathematics hones; and to think critically and construct their knowledge
through exploration of examples and dialog.

Having taught now for over seven years, at institutions as widely varied
as the California State University Channel Islands, Auburn University,
and Tuskegee University, and having also tutored all levels of
Mathematics---grade school to upper-division college---for more than ten
years now, has illustrated the efficacy of my choice of pedagogy.
My personal experience has demonstrated to me that this approach,
placing emphasis on conceptual understanding,
allows students who have struggled in the traditional Mathematics
classroom to excel in my classroom.
I am convinced that the conceptual approach best prepares all students
to apply mathematical concepts and reasoning, not only in the
Mathematics classroom, but in any academic pursuit, throughout the
student's career, and throughout the student's life.

I believe that educators, in general, are in a position to empower their
students, and I believe that pedagogy should respect the intelligence of
each individual. We are not programming computers, after all.
We are communicating ideas with individuals, laying before them the
tools with which they may build their knowledge.
