To the Lecture Pool Search Committee:

\vfill

My name is Daniel Brice, and I am writing you today to express my interest in filling the Lecture Pool vacancy advertised on MathJobs.Org. Thank you for considering my application. I currently work full-time (with flexible hours) as a software engineer for CJ Affiliate at their corporate headquarters in Santa Barbara. My responsibilities include design and implementation of machine learning algorithms, and I am currently working on a Bayesian-reasoning HTTP server.

I finished my PhD at Auburn University in June 2014 under the direction of Huajun Huang. My dissertation topic was derivations of reductive Lie algebras and applications to zero-product determined algebras. Working in my free time, I have managed to contribute three peer-reviewed papers since graduation, the first with Dr. Huang and the other two self-authored. I intend to continue to contribute to my field as I find the time.

You will find me to be an excellent teacher. I have been independently teaching university Mathematics since 2007: the student teaching load at Auburn is two courses per semester every semester, so you will find me to be far more experienced than my 2014 graduate date suggests. Additionally, I spent one year teaching at the renowned Tuskegee University and one year teaching under the quarter system at Cal State Bakersfield. I can teach any undergraduate Mathematics course, including courses specialized to education and engineering (with the possible exception of \emph{Chaotic Dynamics and Bifurcation Theory}). Graduate courses I would like to teach include \emph{Matrix Analysis,} \emph{Modern Algebra,} \emph{Foundations of Topology,} \emph{Homotopy Theory,} \emph{Lie Groups and Lie Algebras,} \emph{Homological Algebra,} and \emph{Real Analysis.} I would also consider teaching special topics courses in multilinear algebra, linear preservers, and category theory.

I have included recommendation letters from Drs. Holmes, Huang, and Tam of Auburn University. As I have not been conducting an academic job search this year or last, these recommendation letters may appear stale. Should you find these letters to be insufficient in their current form, I can trouble these gentlemen to update their prose. Also upon request, I can provide teaching evaluations from my peers at Cal State Bakersfield if you believe it will be useful.

Respectfully yours,
