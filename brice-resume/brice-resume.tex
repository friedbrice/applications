\sechead{Projects Since Graduation}

  As a full-time educator --
  often requiring 50 or more hours a week --
  these projects represent my use of spare time.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item{
      Published two peer-reviewed scientific articles,
      submitted a third, and finishing a fourth
    }
    \item{
      Gave four professional presentations at conferences and colloquiums
    }
    \item{
      With team, designed and developed web application
      for automated image analysis:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{
          Analyzes images from webcam feed, compares against training set data
        }
        \item{
          Leverages mathematics of gradient vector fields
          and principle component analysis
        }
        \item{
          Coded in Haskell, Bash, and Ruby,
          and accesses the Twitter API
        }
      \end{itemize}
    }
    \item{
      With A. Brice, designing automated tools to assist students
      in learning mathematics and abstract syntax
    }
    \item{
      Designed problems database in LaTeX,
      and supporting LaTeX packages implementing the database logic
    }
    \item{
      Created blog app using MongoDB, Node.js, and Express framework
      as part of self-study MongoDB course
    }
  \end{itemize}

\sechead{Relevant Skills}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item{
      Demonstrated ability to understand complex systems
      and leverage understanding to solve challenging problems
    }
    \item{
      Demonstrated strong communication, organization, and interpersonal skills
      (Not many Math professors can say they are unafraid to share their
      RateMyProfessors reviews. Look me up.)
    }
    \item{
      Demonstrated ability to communicate highly-technical concepts clearly
      to non-experts
    }
    \item{
      Demonstrated ability to work both independently and in a group setting,
      and to mentor team members
    }
    \item{
      Understanding of mathematical models for data analysis --
      such as tensor decomposition, persistent homology,
      singular value decomposition, and Perron-Frobenius theory --
      and the ability to quickly learn new techniques
    }
    \item{
      Deep understanding of functional programming
      and its uses for safe, maintainable, parallelizable code
    }
    \item{
      Experience using Haskell for scientific computing and data analysis
    }
    \item{
      Understanding of object-oriented programming, asynchronous style,
      and their uses in software engineering
    }
    \item{
      Exposure to Python and JavaScript, and an interest in developing my talent
    }
    \item{
      Experienced using Linux as everyday desktop
      and as development environment
    }
    \item{
      Experienced using LaTeX and HTML
      for professional communication and templating
    }
    \item{
      Voracious appetite for knowledge,
      and the ability to learn new skills quickly
    }
  \end{itemize}
